# <a name="issue"></a> Submission Guidelines

Before you submit an issue, please search the issue tracker. An issue for your problem might already exist and the discussion might inform you of workarounds readily available.

We only respond to the following situations:

- If you find a bug in the source code, you can help us by [Submitting Bug-Issue](#submitting-an-issue-of-bug) to our GitHub Repository.

- You alse can request a new feature by [Submitting an Feature-Issue](#submitting-an-issue-of-new-feature) to us.

- Or you find a commit is not clear or unreasonable, you can [Submit Commit-Issue](#submitting-an-issue-of-unreasonable-commit) to us.

## <a name="bug_issue"></a> Submitting an Issue of Bug

If you find a bug in the source code, you can help us by submit-issue. Or even better, you can [Submit a Pull Request](./pull_request.md) with a fix.

We want to fix all the issues as soon as possible, but before fixing a bug, we need to reproduce and confirm it.
In order to reproduce bugs, we require that you provide a minimal reproduction.
Having a minimal reproducible scenario gives us a wealth of important information without going back and forth to you with additional questions.

A minimal reproduction allows us to quickly confirm a bug (or point out a coding problem) as well as confirm that we are fixing the right problem.

We require a minimal reproduction to save maintainers' time and ultimately be able to fix more bugs.
Often, developers find coding problems themselves while preparing a minimal reproduction.
We understand that sometimes it might be hard to extract essential bits of code from a larger codebase, but we really need to isolate the problem before we can fix it.

Unfortunately, we are not able to investigate / fix bugs without a minimal reproduction, so if we don't hear back from you, we are going to close an issue that doesn't have enough info to be reproduced.

## <a name="feature_issue"></a> Submitting an Issue of New Feature

You also can request a new feature by issue-submit.

If you would like to implement a new feature, please consider the size of the change in order to determine the right steps to proceed:

* For a **Major Feature**, first open an issue and outline your proposal so that it can be discussed.
  This process allows us to better coordinate our efforts, prevent duplication of work, and help you to craft the change so that it is successfully accepted into the project.

* **Small Features** can be crafted and directly [Submitted a Pull Request](./pull_request.md).

Details of the modified specification can be found [Details of Issue of Feature](./request_issue.md)

## <a name="commit_issue"></a> Submitting an Issue of Unreasonable Commit

If you find a commit is not clear or unreasonable, you also can submit-issue to our GitHub Repository.

Details of the modified specification can be found [Details of Issue of Commit](./commit_issue.md)
