## <a name="question"></a> Divide into Question and Problem

Before you submit an issue, please categorize your request under question and problem. The reason for categorizing is to ensure that the issue is neat and only addresses the needs of the project.

we recommend using [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/angular) to ask support-related questions.

To save your and our time, we will systematically close all issues that are requests for general support and redirect people to Stack Overflow.

Stack Overflow is a much better place to ask questions since:

- there are thousands of people willing to help on Stack Overflow
- questions and answers stay available for public viewing so your question/answer might help someone else
- Stack Overflow's voting system assures that the best answers are prominently visible.
